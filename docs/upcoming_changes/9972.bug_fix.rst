Fix issue in code generation for array set-slice.
-------------------------------------------------

The code generation for array set-slice was inadvertently written as being CPU
target specific. This is now rectified and refactored so as to provide a
"generic" target version that should be safe to use everywhere, along with an
``@overload``-able stub to allow targets to implement custom versions as needed.
