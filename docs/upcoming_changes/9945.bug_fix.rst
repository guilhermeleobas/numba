Fix static type checker support for ``numba.core.types``
--------------------------------------------------------

When Numba 0.61 introduced the split type system, it resulted in dynamic type 
behavior that was incompatible with static type checkers. To resolve this,
we've added a type stub file (``.pyi``) for ``numba.core.types`` that provides
explicit type annotations.
