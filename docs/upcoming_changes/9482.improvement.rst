Python 3.12 ``sys.monitoring`` support is added to Numba's dispatcher.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Python 3.12 introduced a new module ``sys.monitoring`` that makes available an
event driven monitoring API for use in tools that need to monitor execution e.g.
debuggers or profilers. Numba's dispatcher class (the code that handles transfer
of control between the Python interpreter and compiled code) has been updated to
emit ``sys.monitoring.events.PY_START`` and ``sys.monitoring.events.PY_RETURN``
as appropriate. This allows tools that are watching for these events to identify
when control has entered and returned from compiled code. As a result of this
change, Numba compiled code is now identified by ``cProfile`` in the same way
that it has been historically i.e. it will be present in performance profiles.
